Punch List
 - need to get back to where I was with the older interface
 - 

SHORT TERM:
- spell check default
- tagging selected text (context menu?)
- create entity
- collapse/expand nodes
- cancel tag editing
- list required elements of node
- auto indenting/node cycle (tab control) general preference
- attribute editing
- new document (tags, etc)
- search replace
- outline
- validate nodes as they are edited (xmlValidateElement). spin thread to do it in background
- entity sidebar
- speed on autocomplete scrolling?

LONG TERM:
- DTD catalogs
- backup copy
- version control
- includes
- built-int calculator/spreadsheet :)
